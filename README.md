# Spring Core - Bootcamp - Starter

For this experiment we do not provide any starter template.
The idea is to use the Spring Boot Starter at https://start.spring.io/
   
## Start database

Make sure you have installed Docker Compose. The database can be started as a Docker container as follows:
```
docker-compose up -d
```
